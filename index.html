So, is your password compromised? Now it is!
You just submitted it to a random website.

There's a chance it wasn't compromised before, but now it definitely is.
I am telling you that I did not save your password, nor did I send it anywhere.
However, you can't guarantee this, so you have to consider this password to be compromised.

The password you submitted: "<strong><span class="thepw"></span></strong>", could be anywhere.  You didn't even have to click the button.
Anything you type on any web page could be sent to any other site at any time.
You have to trust that the site you're using would not do that.

There are some basic security practices you could follow to prevent this in the future.
</pre>
<ul>
<li>Use a different password for each site.</li>
<li>Don't give out your password to anybody who shouldn't have it.</li>
<li>Always check the URL to ensure it's where you want to be.</li>
<li>If at all possibble, use the HTTPS version of a page and not the HTTP version</li>
<li>If an email wants you to click a link, and doesn't refer to you by name or an accurate account number, immediately be suspicious.</li>
<li>When it comes to especially sensitive sites like banking and medical, don't click links to get there, type the URL yourself.</li>
</ul>
<pre>
This site was setup to act as a warning. I didn't store nor send your password anywhere, but you can never be too careful.

My recommendation to you: 
You should change the password you submitted here, "<strong><span class="thepw"></span></strong>" and don't reuse it (or any common variation of it) again.
