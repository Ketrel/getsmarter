##Get Smarter
This is an html file which claims it will check your password to see if it's been compromise.  
Upon clicking the button to do so, it will use JS to change the page to a message explaining why what was just done was bad.

It's intended as a instructional method to teach friends/family/users about being more careful with their passwords.

###Disclaimer  
* The actual HTML form does not contain any location to submit any information entered  
* The button is a button and not a submit input  
* The javascript used does not send data anywhere, it only modified the HTML locally on the browser
